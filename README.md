 Real-Time Collaborative Editor

A real-time collaborative text editor built with React, TipTap, TailwindCSS, and Socket.io. Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously with live updates and user-specific highlights. 

This project demonstrates how to implement real-time collaboration using WebSockets and a rich text editor. It supports multiple users working on the same document at the same time with visible distinctions for each user's edits and identity.
